# Add Your Headshot Image

To add your professional headshot to the website:

1. **Save your image** as `saswat-headshot.jpg` in the `ui/public/` folder
2. **Image requirements:**
   - Format: JPG/JPEG
   - Recommended size: At least 400x400 pixels (square aspect ratio works best)
   - The image will be automatically cropped to fit the circular frames

3. **File location:** `ui/public/saswat-headshot.jpg`

4. **After adding the image:**
   - The website will automatically use your headshot in:
     - Hero section (small circular image)
     - About Me page (large circular image)
   - Both will have beautiful purple borders and shadows

## Alternative Image Names
If you prefer a different filename, you can also use:
- `saswat-headshot.png`
- `saswat-photo.jpg`
- `profile.jpg`

Just make sure to update the `src` attribute in the components accordingly.

## Image Optimization Tips
- Keep the file size under 500KB for fast loading
- Use a high-quality image for crisp display
- Professional headshot with good lighting works best
